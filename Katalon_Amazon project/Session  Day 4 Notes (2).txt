--> Base line documents consists of requirements( FRS/SRS/CRS/BRS) --> Analysis of SDLC-->copy is given to testing people -->study these baseline documents

types of requirements: 
    1) Functional Requirements:
        --> No. if inputs( Ex: gmail_Login : useid, pwd  = 2)
        ---> No of outputs ( land of inbox =1)
        --> No of internal files ( DB files = 2)
        ---> No of External files (No external files:0)
       ---> No of enquiries (Search options =0)
Flow of Gmail_Login (Steps)
   
1) Launuch the browser     Inputs/Test Data :(Ex: chrome/firefox/edge/IE/Safari)
2) Give URL    inputs/Test Data:(http://www.gmail.com)
3) Enter valid useid : mamatha@gmail.com  (Testdata)
4) Enter valid password:XXXXXX
5) Click on OK button

Checking above functionality is called functional testing/black box testing/GUI testing

Ex:UFT,QTP, katalop, Selenium, RFT etc... 

    
    2) Non-functional requirements:
    
--> performance
    ex: load time, response time

Techniquces:
   1) load testing: Gradually increasing the load and testing the application performance is called the load testing
   2) Stress testing:Testing application at peak level loads is called stress testing
   3) Spike testing: Suddenly flooding huge amounts of loads and testing the application performance is called spike testing
   4)Volume testing: DB/backend testing (Huge data (1 tera) when your trying to delete/update/create)

Automation tools : Ex: load runner, JMeter (Open source) etc...

    3)System requirements
    4)Customer requirements


Regression Testing:

Def: Testing Modified build is called regression testing

Types:

1) Re-Test All
2) Selection based regression testing: 
--> selecting Test cases from BVA (Boundary value analysis),EP(Equivalence partition), Prioritized TC, frequently used features/bugs, complex features
 
3) Prioritized regression testing: 
  

    Analysis : After gathering requiremnts--> each requiremtns is given a uniqueID, also give priority 

RTM's (Requirement tracebility matrix)

Acceptance Tesiting;

1) Alpha Testing: 
--> Company site
-->people involved in alpha testing: developer,PM, BA's
--> controlled environment 
--> customer invited to company to demonstrate the s/w

2) Beta Testing: 
-->Customer site
---> S/w is installed at customer environment
--> No company people are involved 
---> beta testing happened no-controlled environment
--> Customer can use the s/w as his own and give his feedback to company
